# Election analysis
## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections has given yout the task of auditing the results of a recent local congressional election. 
The tasks were
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote. 

## Resources

1. election_results.csv 
2. Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Summary 

An analysis of the Colorado congressional election was taken. Looking at number of votes cast, candidates voted for, and percentage of votes, and subsequent winner of election based off the data given. There was a total of 369,711 votes. There were three candidates who recieved votes: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. With the candidates receiving, 23%, 73.8%, and 3.1%, respectively. With Diana DeGette coming out as the winner of the popular vote. 

#### Challenge Overview 

The analysis prompted the use of python to sift through the .csv, and iterate through the data for each candidate's votes, as well as aggragating the votes to be assigned to one candidate and find the totals. Using for loops, a lot of the tabulations were able to be done synchronously, as well as calculating and tabulating the data and writing it data to a .txt file.  

#### Challenge Summary
Using python to declare variables such as candidate_options and candidate_results, allowed us to make use of a lot of python's functions and succinctly amalgamize a large set of data. Many of the variables simply centered around the candidate's--so as long as there were enough variables created, the python functions were pretty straight forward and allowed for a straightforward anaylsis of the data.
