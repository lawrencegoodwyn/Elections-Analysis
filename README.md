# Election analysis
## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections has given yout the task of auditing the results of a recent local congressional election. 
The tasks were
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote. 
6. Count the number of votes per county
7. Calculate the percentage of county votes
8. Determine county with greatest number of votes and percentage of congressional race won.

## Summary 

An analysis of the Colorado congressional election was taken. Looking at number of votes cast, candidates voted for and percentage of votes, and counties and subsequent winner of election based off the data given. There was a total of 369,711 votes. There were three candidates who recieved votes: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. With the candidates receiving, 23%, 73.8%, and 3.1%, respectively. Three counties participated in the election: Denver, Arapahoe, and Jefferson. And three counties accounting for 82.8%, 6.7% , and 10.5 %7%, respectively. Diana DeGette came out as the winner of the popular vote. 

## Results

- A total of 369,711 votes were cast in the election. 
- Votes by County
  - Jefferson: 38,855 (10.5%)
  - Denver: 306,055 (82.8%)
  - Arapahoe: 24,801 (6.7%)
- Denver County had the largest number of votes with 306,055 votes. 
- Votes by Candidate
  - Charles Casper Stockham 85,213 (23%)
  - Diana DeGette 272,892 (73.8%)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane 11,606 (3.1%)
- Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes. 

## Election Audit Summary

This script offers great insight to other elections as any data source contained in a .csv can be used. The code could be used as is, or modified and extended to include filters such as percentages of votes per candidate in a county--to give users a more detailed look into how the voters are voting by county. To achieve this, a line of code that contains a conditional statement with the candidate's names and the county within the for loop, would achieve something like this. Moreover, if there was more demographics associated with the ballot information--this data could be greatly expanded to give users a more detailed view of the voting data. Someone would have to extract the demographic from the .csv and then build the code for what they are looking for.

##### Challenge Overview 

The analysis prompted the use of python to sift through the .csv, and iterate through the data for each candidate's votes, as well as aggragating the votes to be assigned to one candidate and find the totals. Using for loops, a lot of the tabulations were able to be done synchronously, as well as calculating and tabulating the data and writing it data to a .txt file.  

##### Challenge Summary
Using python to declare variables such as candidate_options and candidate_results, allowed us to make use of a lot of python's functions and succinctly amalgamize a large set of data. Many of the variables simply centered around the candidate's--so as long as there were enough variables created, the python functions were pretty straight forward and allowed for a straightforward anaylsis of the data.
